        <p>I am a wife and mother of 3. My family and I have lived in Pasco County for four years. We purchased our first home in Trinity, Florida, which is a wonderful community full of great neighbors. Similarly to the nearby community of Land O’ Lakes, our community is an area with amazing schools and parents who are very involved in their children’s education. Like all parents, we want to give our children the opportunity to thrive, achieve academic excellence, and accomplish their dreams.</p>
        <p>My son has experienced overt racism and prejudice in school. This year, it has gotten so bad that we have seriously considered moving to another county. It has negatively impacted him and his interactions with others. I was very concerned with what was going on and then I met Brittany Powell. After a brief conversation with her, she was very surprised to hear my story. Her experience was so different than mine. She worked at Wiregrass Ranch High School in Wesley Chapel as a teacher. Her school was extremely inclusive and diversity was valued from the top. Their principal firmly believes in it and engrains it in all the teachers in her school. Instead of moving and avoiding addressing the issue, we decided to speak up and become the voice of change.</p>
        <p>We decided to join forces and that lead to grass roots movement we named Pasco County Agents for Change. From our initial conversation, we quickly realized that we wanted to create a community where diversity and inclusion were weaved into the fabric of our community. To make this happen, we need your voice. By treating each other equally and with respect, we have the potential to disrupt the current entrenched practices and introduce a new way of thinking that value our differences and understand how this makes the world a better place.</p>

        <h3>Co-founder</h3>
        <p>My awareness of differences came at an early age. In 1st grade I looked around my classroom and realized that I was the only brown girl. I began my journey of searching for images that looked like me. I began to devour books with protagonists that looked like me. This shaped the type of educator I became. After receiving my Master's in Secondary English Education, I began teaching with the mission to make sure all of my students felt heard and included. Teaching high school English in were some of the most rewarding years of my life. My goals every year was to not only teach the skills students need but to also allow them learn about who they are as well as learn how to “walk around in someone else's shoes". I taught in Hillsborough and Pasco county, always searching out schools who appreciated diversity as much as I do. Now as a adjunct professor at Pasco-Hernando State College I get the pleasure to work with a very diverse population of students. I started PCAC with the Hope’s that we all not just understand the importance of diversity but to also make it a conscious effort to incorporate it into the fabric of our educational system.</p>
